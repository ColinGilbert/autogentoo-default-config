A user will place the /etc (and other) files to be copied into the root filesystem of the output images.
All that has to be done is to create a directory of the same name as the root system, create the files, and we're good to go!
Username and permissions are preservedi (or should be - file a bug if they're not!) , so mind your uid/gid's!
